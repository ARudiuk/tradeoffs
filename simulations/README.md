#Simulations

This directory contains MATLAB code to recreate the simulations and figures reported in Kool, Cushman, & Gershman (2016).

The functions that computes the surfaces of standardized regression coefficients will take a long time to finish with the number of iterations that are used in the paper (1000). This process can be sped up by breaking up these analyses and running them in parallel jobs on your institution's computing cluster.
